# My amazing project.

A quick description of my project.

## For developers

The idea here is to create self-documenting designs/prototypes, and thus it will
be beneficial to know where to look in the source.

### Start here
- `index.html`: open this in your browser to view and interact with the
  prototype
- `app.js`: the main project file that holds design/interaction logic

### &helip;then here
- `/images`: project-specific graphics and assets
- `/modules`: project-specific components and design patterns that have been
  abstracted away either to keep `app.js` more readable or because they are not
  required for implementation
- `/node_modules`: holds third-party components that may or may not be relevant
  for implementation
- `package.json`: required for developing this prototype and lists third-party
  module dependencies
