# My Framer.js project

A quick description of my project.

## For developers

The idea here is to create self-documenting designs/prototypes, and thus it will
be beneficial to know where to look in the source.

- `index.html`: open this in your browser to view and interact with the
  prototype
- `index.js`: the main project file that holds design/interaction logic
- `/images`: project-specific graphics and assets
- `/modules`: project-specific components and design patterns that have been
  abstracted away either to keep `index.js` more readable or because they are
  not required for implementation
- `/node_modules`: holds third-party components that may or may not be relevant
  for implementation
- `package.json`: required for developing this prototype and lists third-party
  module dependencies
- `Makefile`: used for development (assumes [Node][1] is installed)
